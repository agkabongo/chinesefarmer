        <p> In nature, <span class="good">good</span> & Evil do not exist. The Universe itself is neither <span

        <p>In life, there are 4 types of people.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>people who think the Internet is <span class="good">good</span></li>

                        Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. From that rock’s perspective on Mars
                        or
                        that gaz
                        opinion from Jupiter, nothing cares about your problems. Up there, it’s just not serious, and
                        there’s no such
                        thing as an issue.

                        Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain. Nothing exists if the brain doesn’t
                        think
                        it. Nothing
                        exists neither if our senses don’t transmit the message. That means that if we mis sense, our
                        reality changes.
                        That’s possible because our perception is limited : you can’t see at 360 degrees for example.
                    </p>

            </div>
            <div class="rockstory">
                <p>
                    If we mis translate the message, our reality changes. If we think it in a way, our reality changes
                    depending
                    on that way.
                    Therefore, if we can change reality that much, everything’s fake.
                    They’re proofs to that.

                <p>Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that person as divine. Pull
                    yourself out of
                    that grip and the divine falls from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself differently.
                    But the person
                    is the same, you just changed your mind. Everything works like that : it’s not just that you can
                    make your
                    world, it’s that you passively do it anyway.

                <p>
                    Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors
                    came around
                    to commiserate. They said,<q class="villagers"> We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away.
                        This is most
                        unfortunate.</q> The farmer again said,<q class="farmer">
                        Is it <span class="good">good</span>? Is it <span class="bad">bad</span>? I don't know.</q> The
                    next
                    day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back
                    and
                    said,<q class="villagers">
                        “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</q> The farmer
                    again
                    said, <q class="farmer"> Is it
                        <span class="good">good</span>? Is it <span class="bad">bad</span>? I don't know.</q>
                </p>


                <p>
                    The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and
                    broke his
                    leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="villagers"> Oh dear, that’s too <span
                            class="bad">bad</span>, </q> and
                    the farmer
                    responded, <q class="farmer">Is
                        it <span class="good">good</span>? Is it <span class="bad">bad</span>? I don't know.</q> The
                    next day the
                    conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son
                    because he had a
                    broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="villagers"> Isn’t that great!
                    </q>Again,
                    he said, <q class="farmer"> Is it
                        <span class="good">good</span>? Is it <span class="bad">bad</span>? I don't know.</q>

            <p>
                The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible
                to
                tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span
                    class="bad">bad</span> —
                because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be
                the
                consequences of <span class="good">good</span> fortune.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="good">good</span> and <span class="bad">bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span
                class="good">good</span> for <a
                href="https://www.proserveit.com/blog/five-monkeys-experiment-lessons">monkeys</a> , but monkeys are not
            <span class="good">good</span> for bananas. Let's
            not make a big deal out of it...
